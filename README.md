# Budget-Meal-App
Budget Meal is a web-application built to help food enthusiasts who are on a tight budget. 
This application will provide them a list of nearby food places or carinderias that can serve them great, delicious meals and at the same time, suits well to their existing budget. For example, a user will input an amount of 100 pesos after a few seconds, 
a list of food places that serve meals/foods that are priced not above 100 pesos will appear.

This web app was initially built in Apache Tomcat using HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS and Java Servlets.
