	<h1>Welcome to Budget Meal App</h1>
	<p>Budget Meal is a web-application built to help food enthusiasts who are on a tight budget. This application will provide them a list of nearby food places or carinderias that can serve them great, delicious meals and at the same time, it will still suit well to their existing budget for food (e.g., One user will input an amount of 100 pesos after a few seconds, a list of food places that serve meals/foods that are priced not above 100 pesos will appear.) </p>
	<p>In addition, food chain/places owners/managers can register in this website for them to include their places to the database and get added to the list of results when a user make the next query.</p>
